# Kerbian Admin UI

Kerbian provides a built-in Flask-based Admin UI for your models.

1. Define your models in `kerbian/db/models/`.
2. Run `python kerbian/admin/app.py`.
3. Access `http://localhost:5000` to manage your data.

You can extend the admin UI for more models and add authentication, filters, and relationships.
