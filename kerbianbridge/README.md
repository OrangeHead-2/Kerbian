# KerbianBridge

KerbianBridge is a from-scratch, cross-platform native bridge library.

- **Java/ObjC/Swift native code** for Android/iOS
- **Socket-based IPC** protocol for high performance
- **Message protocol** for UI tree, events, and native modules
- **Python client** for seamless mobile runtime integration

This library is the backbone of the Kerbian frameworkâ€™s true cross-platform power.

## Usage

- Embed the native server in your Android/iOS app
- Use `NativeBridgeClient` in Python to call native APIs and manage the UI

See `protocol/bridge_protocol.md` for details.
