# KerbianCore Monitoring — Security Considerations

## Logging

- **Sensitive Data:**  
  Be careful not to log secrets, passwords, API keys, or personally identifiable information (PII).
  - Use field filtering to redact or omit sensitive fields.
  - Consider a custom filter to remove or mask fields (e.g., `"password": "*****"`).
- **Log Access:**  
  Protect log files and log aggregation endpoints with proper file permissions and authentication.

```python
# Example: Redact sensitive fields before logging
from kerbiancore.monitoring.logger import Logger

logger = Logger("secure")
user_data = {"username": "bob", "password": "1234"}
safe_data = dict(user_data)
safe_data["password"] = "*****"
logger.info("User login", **safe_data)
```

## Metrics and Tracing

- **Anonymization:**  
  When using analytics or distributed tracing, do not include user PII unless necessary and properly consented.
- **Export/Transmission:**  
  Secure any remote monitoring endpoints using TLS/SSL.  
  Use authentication for HTTP/TCP sinks.

---

## Alerts

- **Alert Fatigue:**  
  Avoid spamming operators with too many alerts; use sensible suppression and escalation.
- **Alert Spoofing:**  
  Make sure alert channels (email/webhook) can’t be easily abused (e.g., via unauthenticated endpoints).

---

## Threading/Async

- **Resource Exhaustion:**  
  Carefully tune async log and alert buffers to avoid memory exhaustion under load.
- **Deadlocks:**  
  All queue/locking mechanisms are designed to avoid deadlocks, but test under production-like load.

## Code Auditing

- KerbianCore Monitoring is implemented without third-party dependencies for maximum auditability and control.
- Review custom sinks/filters/health checks for possible code injection or unsafe operations.

---

## Updates

- Always run the latest release for any security patches.
- Report vulnerabilities via the official KerbianCore channels.
